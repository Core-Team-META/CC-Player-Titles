## Overview

Player Titles allows game creators to give special roles to themselves, dedicated players, and anyone they deem fit for recognition. With a simple module it's easy to dictate and customize a hierarchy of roles. A set of user interface components shows this special recognition for everyone: playerlist, scoreboard, and nameplate.

Includes:
• PlayerTitles - This contains all of the possible social titles and their respective assignments. More documentation can be found in the script itself.
• PlayerList - A compact UI panel listing players and their corresponding teams and titles.
• Player Nameplates - Text above a player's head indicating their username, health, and titles.
• Scoreboard - A large UI panel listing players and their corresponding teams and titles alongside additional stats such as kills, deaths, or even resources.
